# Architectural-Diagrams
Collection of Architectural Diagrams and UI prototypes I have created, demonstrating my design abilities. 

## [MSc Thesis Diagrams](https://github.com/lukehengstenberg/Architectural-Diagrams/tree/main/DPKM)
Diagrams and UI prototypes I created for my MSc thesis. Includes several types of UML - Class, Component, DB Schema, State Transition, Sequence, Use Case; UI Mocks; Architectural; General Planning and Research. <br>
For context please read/download the full thesis [HERE](https://github.com/lukehengstenberg/research/blob/main/MSc%20Thesis%20-%20Data%20Plane%20Key%20Management%20Scheme.pdf), which uses the diagrams as figures to explain the system architecture/processes.
